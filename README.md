# MultiplayerGame
To run the server for the game you need to have node.js, npm, express, socket.io and uuidv4. Install node.js from `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`. Thereafter, run `npm install express`, `npm install socket.io`, `npm install uuidv4` in the command line. Now you are ready to host the game. Thereafter, type `localhost:80` in your web browsers url bar to play the game on your own PC. Alternatively, you can access from within LAN by connecting to the server on port 80. (You need to know the servers local IP address).
